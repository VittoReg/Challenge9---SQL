Hello, and thank you for taking time to read my assignment!


For this assignment I have used Postgres SQL (pgadmin4) and Power BI.

--RELATIONSHIPS SCHEME
I have created the first relationships diagram with power BI and you can find it in this folder (Relationships.pbix, if you have power bi, or you can visualize it
as a .png 'relationships.png'.

--ERD
find the ERD file that was made with postgres 'ERD.pgerd'.

--TABLES
NOTE**: I was unable to export every single table, the only option postgres was giving me was to export them as .csv files. 
I have asked my teacher for help, however she said that by looking into the ERD file, you would be able to see the required constraint for this assignment.

--DATA ANALYSIS
Find these tasks in the 'Data Analysis' folder, which can be loaded and viewed with any SQL version.




--DATES
I believe the only thing I didn't manage to sort was to convert date columns into date type, I have looked into many solutions,
but they were only working for other versions of SQL unfortunately.

Thank you.
